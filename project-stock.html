                Developed an advanced predictive model utilizing LSTM neural network architecture to effectively forecast stock price movements. 
                Employed diverse time-series predictive models and conducted in-depth analysis on the intricate relationship between pension funds and stock prices, 
                illuminating their impact on market dynamics. These invaluable insights provided a solid foundation for strategic decision-making. Enhanced the accuracy of our LSTM model by refining time intervals, 
                resulting in an impressive 6% increase and bolstering our forecasting capabilities. </p>

                Received a challenging assignment from a prominent company to investigate the correlation between pension funds and stock prices. 
                Employing a comprehensive approach involving sophisticated modeling techniques, trend analysis, and seasonality analysis, 
                our findings revealed that the relationship between these factors is not statistically significant. 
                This research established that pension funds do not serve as a strong indicator for price prediction. 
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                Although our initial objective was to uncover a specific correlation, our successful 
                outcome was to demonstrate the absence of a significant connection between pension funds and stock prices. 
                Our achievements in delivering the desired result earned us the prestigious 2nd award. </p>
